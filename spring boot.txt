Building First Application with SpringBoot

Pre-requisites?

To Create a new Spring Boot Application we will use the foolowing in our example
1. Java 1.8+
2. Spring STS
3. Maven

creating spring boot app online :
https://start.spring.io/


Internals of @SpringBootApplication
1. @Configuration
2. @EnableAutoConfiguration
3. @ComponentScan

@Configuration : this annotation helps in spring annotation based configuration.
it indicates that aclass declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the spring container to generate bean defination
and service request for those beans at runtime.

@EnableAutoConfiguration : it tells spring boot to guess how you want to configure spring based on the jar dependancies that you have added.
auto-configure the beans that are present in the classpath. this simplify the developer work by guessing the required beans from 
classpath and configure to run the application.

eg: if H2 is on your classpath and you have not manually configured any database connection beans then spring will auto configure
an in memory database.

@ComponentScan : it itells spring to look for other components , configurations, and service in the specified package.
is able to auto scan detect and register your beans or components from pre-defined project package.
if no package is specified current class package is taken as the root package.


What is Rest API?

RESTful API act as an interface between two application to exchange informaion securely over the internet.
Most business application have to communicate with other internal and third party application to perform various tasks.

client send request--->Json--->get,post,put,delete--->HTTP--->server send response.
